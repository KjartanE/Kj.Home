# Interactive 3D Projects

A collection of interactive 3D visualizations built with Three.js, exploring different rendering techniques and physics simulations.

## Cube Visualization
 
This was my first ever creation within the Processing, p5.js. 
I actually got inspiration to recreate this idea from a Sky-Block Minecraft video where there was a random block placed every 16 blocks (1 chunk) apart.   

This version is a THREE.js recreation of my original, this one mainly focusing on simplicity. 
Where as the last one I had a lot of fun with rotating colors and sync with music. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soJ7ezz3Rl4" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a>

## Solar System

The current version of the solar system call it v1, works and in a simple way achieves the job. 
But i just don't think its that good, I'm not happy with it. I think this idea can go the into so much detail and fun design.

I just find shaders and lighting really awkward when I am trying to portray the sun against all the planets.

I will eventually get back to doing something fun with this.
