## Penrose Tiling

Implementing Penrose tilings - aperiodic patterns that never repeat regardless of how far they're extended. My implementation features:

- L-System based pattern generation for fractal-like growth
- Interactive click-and-drag controls for pattern manipulation
- Custom shader-based rendering for optimal visual output
- Smooth animation system to visualize pattern growth

The core algorithm uses L-System substitution rules to generate these complex geometric patterns. Each iteration creates increasingly detailed self-similar structures while maintaining the fundamental aperiodic property.

## Chladni Patterns

Digital recreation of Chladni figures - the geometric patterns that emerge when vibrating a plate at specific resonant frequencies. The implementation includes:

- Real-time pattern generation via GLSL fragment shaders for performance
- Parameter sliders to adjust n and m modal values for different pattern types
- Customizable color mapping and opacity controls
- Time-based evolution with animated transitions between states

The technical approach involves solving the wave equation for a vibrating plate and visualizing the nodal lines (where amplitude = 0) using shader-based rendering. The standing wave patterns are computed based on eigenfunction solutions.

## Double Pendulum

A double pendulum simulation that demonstrates chaotic dynamics in a simple mechanical system. Features include:

- Accurate physics simulation based on Lagrangian mechanics
- Interactive mouse control for initial conditions
- Motion trail visualization with temporal fading
- Color-coded component rendering for tracking movement
- Responsive design that adapts to viewport dimensions

The implementation solves the coupled differential equations using fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical integration. This provides accuracy while maintaining real-time performance across devices.

## Spirograph

Digital implementation of the classical spirograph drawing toy, generating hypotrochoid and epitrochoid curves. The tool offers:

- Adjustable parameters for gear ratios, hole positions, and rotation rates
- Real-time rendering of parametric curves
- Custom color selection for stroke and background elements
- One-click pattern saving functionality
- Multi-touch support for tablet interactions

The mathematical model uses parametric equations to trace the path of a point on a circle rolling around the inside or outside of another circle. These equations generate continuous curves with fascinating symmetry properties.

## Mandelbrot Set

Interactive explorer for the Mandelbrot set fractal with advanced rendering capabilities. Key features:

- GPU-accelerated zooming and panning for smooth navigation
- Configurable color mapping with customizable gradient palettes
- Optimized escape-time algorithm with early bailout conditions
- Variable iteration depth control for exploring deeper structures

The rendering engine uses complex number arithmetic to iterate the function z = zÂ² + c, tracking how quickly each point escapes a boundary radius (or if it remains bounded). The iteration count determines color mapping for visualizing the fractal boundary.

## Conway's Game of Life

Implementation of Conway's cellular automaton with an expanded feature set. The simulation includes:

- Custom pattern drawing and preset template library
- Cell age visualization using color gradients
- Toroidal grid implementation with edge wrapping
- Comprehensive playback controls (pause, step, reset)

The core logic follows Conway's four rules: underpopulation, survival, overpopulation, and reproduction. Despite this simple ruleset, the simulation exhibits emergent complexity capable of universal computation.
