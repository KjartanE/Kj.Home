summary: 'Initial setup for website'

My goals and plans for this site is to track procedures of any personal projects.

Hoping to keep screenshots and information on setup procedures for any home server needs.

Displaying some unique fun projects and integration that into the style of the site.


## Synth

I have a lot of pictures, videos and links for the history and creation of my synth.
I want to show the full progress of what pictures I do have documented. 

## Portfolio 

Tracking work experience, project tech stacks and utilities I have worked with.

Thoughts on integrating old school projects that were built in next. 
Might host on home server with each project containerized.

## Website

I want to have fun with this site and do something fun and new. 
It's hard to be original but I like trying new things.
