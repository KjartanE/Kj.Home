# Home Server Infrastructure

I've set up a home server running various containerized services managed through Portainer Community Edition. Here's an overview of my current setup and the services I'm running.

## Infrastructure Overview

- **Server Management**: Portainer CE for Docker container management
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose
- **Access Control**: Administrator-level access management

## Active Services

### Security & Network

- **Adguard**: Running as a network-wide ad blocker and DNS manager

### Media & Entertainment

- **Plex Multi-Stack**: Media server setup for streaming personal content
- **Minecraft**: Self-hosted game server for personal use

### File Management

- **Nextcloud**: Personal cloud storage and file synchronization solution

## Technical Implementation

All services are deployed using Docker Compose, which allows for easy service management and configuration. Each stack is isolated and can be managed independently through Portainer's intuitive interface.
