# Interactive 3D Projects

A collection of interactive 3D visualizations built with Three.js, exploring different rendering techniques and physics simulations.

## Cube Visualization

A 3D point cloud visualization arranged in a cube formation. The project features:

- Dynamic point matrix generation with adjustable density
- Orbital camera controls for 360Â° viewing
- Responsive window resizing
- Wireframe rendering with custom shaders

The implementation uses a dot matrix system to generate points in 3D space, creating an ethereal grid-like structure that responds to user interaction.

Reference implementation:

## Chladni Patterns

An interactive visualization of Chladni plate vibration patterns. These patterns emerge from standing waves on a vibrating plate, creating beautiful nodal patterns. Features include:

- Real-time pattern generation using custom GLSL shaders
- Interactive controls for wave parameters (n, m values)
- Color and opacity controls
- Smooth animations with time-based evolution

The patterns are generated using mathematical formulas translated into fragment shaders, creating mesmerizing wave interference patterns.

Reference implementation:

## Double Pendulum

A physics-based simulation of a double pendulum system, demonstrating chaotic motion. Features:

- Accurate physics simulation with gravity and damping
- Interactive mouse control
- Motion trails with fade effects
- Color-coded pendulum arms and joints
- Responsive window sizing

The simulation uses numerical integration to calculate the complex motion of the coupled pendulum system, creating unpredictable and fascinating patterns.

Reference implementation:

## Penrose Tiling

An implementation of Penrose tiling, generating infinite non-repeating patterns. Features:

- L-System based pattern generation
- Interactive generation controls
- Custom shader-based rendering
- Smooth animations during pattern growth
- Dark/light theme support

The project uses a sophisticated L-System algorithm to generate the complex geometric patterns characteristic of Penrose tilings.

Reference implementation:

## Solar System

An interactive 3D visualization of our solar system. Features:

- Accurate orbital mechanics
- Realistic planet scaling and texturing
- Interactive camera controls
- Planet trails with fade effects
- Custom sun shader for realistic solar glow

The visualization uses custom shaders for the sun's corona effect and implements accurate orbital mathematics for planet movements.

Reference implementation:

Each project showcases different aspects of 3D graphics programming, from physics simulations to procedural pattern generation. The implementations use modern Three.js features and custom WebGL shaders to create engaging, interactive experiences.

All projects are built with performance in mind, implementing proper cleanup and disposal of Three.js resources to prevent memory leaks. The code structure follows best practices for React integration with Three.js, using hooks for lifecycle management and clean separation of concerns.
